ResetVXD.exe
------------

In rare cases, if a previously run 3D application has not exited properly
(eg crashed) the VXD is not closed properly and cannot be used by other
3D applications. This will cause an error message "Cannot load SGL.DLL".

This utility ResetVXD.exe resets the VXD.

Do not use wih PowerVR drivers older than 3.1.0b4.
